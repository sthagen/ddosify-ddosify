## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with contributing to Ddosify, follow these steps:

5. Set up your development environment. Go programing language (`Version >= 1.18`) is required to build and run Ddosify. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://go.dev/doc/install) for Go. We also provide [Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile.dev) and Visual Studio Code (VS Code) [remote container configuration](./.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) for development. More information about VS Code remote container can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

6. Run the `main.go` file:

```bash
go run main.go
```
